# SwapGo: The Intelligent Narrative Revolution in Go

## Project Introduction

SwapGo is an innovative Go project aimed at transforming the traditional black and white game into an adventure filled with stories and emotions. By combining Go with advanced Artificial Intelligence Language Models (AI-LLM), we bring life and meaning to every move.

As the game progresses, AI generates real-time story scenes and character dialogues corresponding to the game situation, immersing players and spectators in a dynamically changing narrative world. This is not just a game of Go, but a wonderful journey that unfolds with each stone placed, offering Go enthusiasts an unprecedented experience.

## Project Background

SwapGo is a participating project in the 2024 Claude Hackathon. In an era where AI Go programs have surpassed human abilities, we consider how to use AI technology to create new possibilities for the field of Go.

Our inspiration comes from the essence of Goâ€”military simulation. SwapGo uses AI to simulate war scenarios, allowing players to experience the depth of strategy and tactics while playing. Through this innovative approach, we hope not only to enrich the Go gaming experience but also to help people understand the complexity of war more deeply, thereby promoting the idea of peace.
